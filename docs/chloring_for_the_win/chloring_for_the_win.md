Chloring for the win
---

Welcome to Chloring for the win (CFTW)-- a beginner-friendly guide to using the Chlore programming language.

Since there is no implementation of Chlore publicly available yet, you would not be able to try the examples out unless you write your own implementation, which again, would be impossible, since the specification of Chlore (which is still work-in-progress) isn't published either. But if you are curious about the language, hopefully CFTW will give you a feel of what the language is like.

And this goes without saying, do _not_ use CFTW as a normative reference for the language. It is not made as a replacement for the official specification.

Alright, with that out of the way, let's get some Chloring done.

CFTW assumes you have some understanding of how stack-oriented programming languages work, so before reading any further, you might want to make yourself familiar with some of the concepts of such programming languages in case you aren't already.

You have been lied to
---

Often times, I get recommended programming videos on YouTube where the guy teaching does not even have any idea whatsoever about what he's talking about.

And what boils my blood more is that these YouTubers are getting around thousands, if not millions, of views, meaning millions of people, who might possibly be newbies too, are actually watching these videos hopefully wanting to learn something, when all they're getting is a heck load of incorrect information.

Unfortunately though, some folks often justify it with a "You're getting this information for free" and stuff like that. In my opinion, if you're putting out information on the internet where thousands of people might see it, that information _should_ be correct, or at least you should put in some effort to make sure it is legitimate. And anyway, I consider this kind of act as a form of fraud. Sure, I'm not paying anything for it, but I'm wasting my time watching these worthless, good-for-nothing tutorials when these YouTubers are profitting off of spreading false information, which is unacceptable to me.

This post is about addressing such false claims that I've heard, not just on YouTube, but also, books, and believe it or not, from professors of _certain_ institutions that have generated a lot of hype around them, that they of course should not have gotten in the first place, only if people knew better.

Before I start though, I should mention that I will only talk about how such false information has butchered how some people write C code. From summoning nasal demons to literal UFOs -- these people can do all that sorcery you can ever imagine. All they need is a standard-conforming C compiler, and they'll UB the hell out of it.

Each of the following paragraphs starts with a quote specifying the claim, followed by why said claim does not make any sense at all. In some cases, a quote from the C11 standard (yeah, not a huge fan of the direction C2x is headed) will be included for reference.

Claim 1.

>Characters always use the ASCII character set

They don't. The C11 standard does not mandate any specific values for members of the execution character set. ยง5.2.1 1 of the C11 specification has to say this (emphasis mine):

>Two sets of characters and their associated collating sequences shall be defined: the set in which source files are written (the source character set), and the set interpreted in the execution environment (the execution character set). Each set is further divided into a basic character set, whose contents are given by this subclause, and a set of zero or more locale-specific members (which are not members of the basic character set) called extended characters. The combined set is also called the extended character set. **The values of the members of the execution character set are implementation-defined**.

I think the aforementioned paragraph from the standard is pretty self-explanatory. If only people weren't lazy enough to read the specification.

I would like to add though, the C11 standard does indeed guarantee that UTF-8 string literals are encoded in UTF-8. From ยง6.4.5 6 of the C11 standard (emphasis mine):

>[...] For UTF-8 string literals, the array elements have type char, and are initialized with the characters of the multibyte character sequence, as **encoded in UTF-8**. [...]"

Claim 2.

>Objects of type int always have a size of 4 bytes, objects of type long use 8 bytes, and so on

This is probably one of the most infamous examples of what happens when one does not have any knowledge about the language they're working with whatsoever. The sizes of objects of types other than character types are implementation-defined. I repeat IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED. Sorry for the caps there. From ยง6.5.3.4 5 of the C11 standard (emphasis mine):

>The sizeof operator yields the size (**in bytes**) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the type of the operand. The result is an integer. [...]

Now that we are 100% sure that sizeof yields the size of its operand in *bytes*, we can have a look at paragraph 5 of the same section. From ยง6.5.3.4 5 of the C11 standard (emphasis mine):

>The value of the result of both operators is **implementation-defined**, and its type (an unsigned integer type) is size_t, defined in <stddef.h> (and other headers).

The words "Both operators" in the paragraph refer to the _Alignof and the sizeof operators. Again, I think the paragraph is pretty self-explanatory. So if you were one of those folks who used to believe that C mandates specific sizes for object of every type, because some random guy told you "Oh it is true in Turbo C++, so it must be true for every implementation", which it is not, you probably now know how stuff actually work.
